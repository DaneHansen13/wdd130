        Why Portal Point? Hello and welcome to Portal Point, the quickest way to find the shops you want to go to. You are probably wondering how adding another website to go through to get to where you are trying to go is quicker? Well allow me to explain. With Portal Point you will be able to choose websites that you want to have quick access to through an easy to set up access point. It is similar to the bookmark bar that you might have sites already attached to, but there is only a limited number of sites that can fit on that bar before they spill into a separate tab that you have to open in order to see them.
    </p>
    <p>What can I do here? With Portal Point you will be able to open our site where you will then be able to make a page of links that will take you where you need to go much quicker. All you need to do is type in the site you want to save into our search bar and add it to your page. This site will be best for online shopping since it can be your own personal online mall. Saving different links to online stores will really help save time rather than having to type in the shop you want to visit every time you want to go there. It will allow you to also organize them however you want to, whether that be putting Amazon in your number one spot, your third spot, or not even including it on the list. You can also customize the color scheme of your page. This will give your page a nice personal touch that not every site allows you to have.</p>
    <p>What we need from you? In order for our site to remember your selections you will need to create an account; all we need is your email and first and last name. This will allow us to give a more personal touch to your site. Your information will not be shared with any third-party site. Contact us at idk123@gmail.com</p>
